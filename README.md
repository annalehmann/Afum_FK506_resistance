## Genomic analysis of *Aspergillus fumigatus* A1163 FK506-resistant isolates
This repository contains code used for the sequence and ploidy analysis and associated figure generation in: \
\
Lehmann AE, Ramírez EA, Keller NP, Heitman J. Whole-chromosome duplications drive antimicrobial resistance in *Aspergillus fumigatus*.
*bioRxiv* 2025. https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.09.29.679244 \
\
It includes steps to: \
  • Identify sequence variants relative to our laboratory A1163 strain. \
  • Predict variant effects. \
  • Align reads to the CEA10 reference assembly. \
  • Plot normalized read depth across the genome. \
  • Generate Figure 1D, Table S1, and Table S3.
